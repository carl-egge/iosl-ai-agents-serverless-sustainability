# Integrating AI Agents into Serverless Platforms for Enhanced Sustainability

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores how **AI agents** can improve the **sustainability and efficiency** of **serverless computing platforms** such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or OpenFaaS.  
Serverless computing simplifies deployment and scaling, but its growing adoption also increases energy consumption and environmental impact.  
By integrating **intelligent, autonomous AI agents**, we aim to optimize resource allocation, deployment decisions, and code execution to achieve **better energy efficiency and performance**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Understand** how serverless workflows operate and where optimization opportunities exist.
- **Design and implement** AI agent(s) that support sustainability-oriented decisions in serverless environments.
- **Measure and evaluate** the effects of AI integration on resource utilization, performance, and energy efficiency.

## 🧩 Project Phases

### 1. Research & Brainstorming
- Study the **serverless computing model** and typical workflows.
- Explore **Agentic AI principles** and agent design patterns.
- Define the **goals and roles** of the proposed agent(s).
- Determine **integration points** between serverless infrastructure and AI components.
- Identify **key evaluation metrics** (e.g., latency, energy use, cost efficiency).
- Research available **tools and data sources** for collecting metrics.
- Explore **AI models** and frameworks suitable for reasoning, decision-making, or optimization.
- Ensure all proposals are **supported by research** and credible sources.

### 2. Design
- Define the **architecture** of the system (serverless + AI integration).
- Plan the **experimental setup** for testing and measuring performance.

### 3. Implementation
- Build the prototype or proof of concept.
- Run experiments and **evaluate results** based on defined metrics.
- Document findings and discuss sustainability implications.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Serverless Computing (FaaS):** A cloud model where functions are executed on demand without managing infrastructure.
- **AI Agents:** Autonomous systems capable of perception, reasoning, and action to achieve defined goals.
- **Sustainability in Cloud Computing:** Efforts to minimize environmental impact by optimizing energy and resource consumption.
