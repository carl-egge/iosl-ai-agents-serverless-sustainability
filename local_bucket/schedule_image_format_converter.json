While europe-west1 offers lower emissions (31.6kg CO2/year vs us-central1's 57.1kg CO2/year), resulting in 25.5kg CO2 saved annually, the cost to achieve this reduction is $88/year, or approximately $3.45 per kg CO2 avoided. Under a strict 'COSTS' priority, this substantial increase in cost is not justified for the corresponding emissions reduction, aligning with the principle that a significant cost increase for a non-extreme emissions reduction is not warranted.

While europe-west1 offers lower emissions (31.6kg CO2/year vs us-central1's 57.1kg CO2/year), resulting in 25.5kg CO2 saved annually, the cost to achieve this reduction is $88/year, or approximately $3.45 per kg CO2 avoided. Under a strict 'COSTS' priority, this substantial increase in cost is not justified for the corresponding emissions reduction, aligning with the principle that a significant cost increase for a non-extreme emissions reduction is not warranted. This specific time slot also represents one of the highest carbon intensities (574 gCO2eq/kWh) within the selected cost-optimal region for this 24-hour period."
